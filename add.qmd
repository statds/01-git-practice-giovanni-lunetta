There are many common machine learning models that I have some backround in using.
This includes:
1. Linear regression
1. Logistic Regression
1. Multiclass Logistic Regression
My favorite is probably Multiclass Logistic Regression because I find it very interesting how a machine learning model can correctly create the proper thresholds.
