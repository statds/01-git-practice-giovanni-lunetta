There are many common machine learning models that I have some backround in using.
This includes:
1. Linear regression
1. Logistic Regression
1. Multiclass Logistic Regression
My favorite is probably Multiclass Logistic Regression because I find it very interesting how a machine learning model can correctly create the proper thresholds.

According to numpy.org, "NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It is a Python library that provides a multidimensional array object, various derived objects (such as masked arrays and matrices), and an assortment of routines for quick operations on arrays, including mathematical, logical, shape manipulation, sorting, selecting, I/O, discrete Fourier transforms, basic linear algebra, basic statistical operations, random simulation and much more."

Another frequently used package for machine learning is Tensorflow.
