# Exercise 3
Monty Hall problem through simulation.

```{python}
# allows us to generate random numbers and make random selections
import random

# defines a function called monty_hall which takes two
# arguments. ndoors represents the number of doors in the
# experiment while ntrials represents the number of trials
# in the simulation.
def monty_hall(ndoors, ntrials):
    
    # initialze two variables to keep track of the number of wins
    switch_wins = 0
    no_switch_wins = 0
    
    # this for loop runs for ntrials
    for i in range(ntrials):

        # creates a list containing ndoors from 0 to ndoors-1 doors
        doors = [i for i in range(ndoors)]

        # randomly chooses one of these ndoors and assigns it to car
        # this variable will represent the door with the car behind it
        car = random.choice(doors)

        # randomly chooses one of these ndoors and assigns it to choice 
        # this variable will represent the door that the contestant initially 
        # chooses
        choice = random.choice(doors)

        # checks if the door the contestant initially chose is the door with the
        # car behind it. If it is, the no-switch strategy wins, otherwise the 
        # switch strategy wins
        if choice == car:
            no_switch_wins += 1
        else:
            switch_wins += 1
    
    # returns the proportion of wins for switch
    return switch_wins/ntrials

# stores the percentages in two different variables
win3 = monty_hall(3, 1000)*100
win5 = monty_hall(5, 1000)*100

print("When there are three doors, switching the door is the correct choice", win3)
print("percent of the time and the wrong choice", 100-win3, "percent of the time.\n")
print("When there are five doors, switching the door is the correct choice", win5)
print("percent of the time and the wrong choice", 100-win5, "percent of the time.")
